abstract = {A mechanical model is proposed which quantitatively describes the dynamics of the centre of gravity (c.g.) during the take-off phase of the long jump. The model entails a minimal but necessary number of components: a linear leg spring with the ability of lengthening to describe the active peak of the force time curve and a distal mass coupled with nonlinear visco-elastic elements to describe the passive peak. The influence of the positions and velocities of the supported body and the jumper's leg as well as of systemic parameters such as leg stiffness and mass distribution on the jumping distance were investigated. Techniques for optimum operation are identified: (1) There is a minimum stiffness for optimum performance. Further increase of the stiffness does not lead to longer jumps. (2) For any given stiffness there is always an optimum angle of attack. (3) The same distance can be achieved by different techniques. (4) The losses due to deceleration of the supporting leg do not result in reduced jumping distance as this deceleration results in a higher vertical momentum. (5) Thus, increasing the touch-down velocity of the jumper's supporting leg increases jumping distance.}

title = {Knee Flexion/Extension Angle Measurement for Gait Analysis Using Machine Learning Solution “MediaPipe Pose” and Its Comparison with Kinovea®},
journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
abstract = {Human Gait Analysis is crucial in diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and rehabilitation. It requires the measurement of gait parameters like joint angles, angular motion, ground reaction force (GRF), momentum, step width, step length, velocity, etc. This study introduces a markerless, easy-to-use approach for measuring one of the gait parameters i.e., knee flexion/extension angle, and verifies it with an existing standard marker-based approach. Knee flexion/extension angle is calculated via Machine Learning (ML) pose estimation model “MediaPipe Pose” and Computer vision (CV) without the use of markers. For the verification of accuracy, the obtained values are compared with the data on each video frame obtained from Kinovea® which is a marker-based motion analysis software. A correlation of 0.941 was observed between the results from Kinovea® and MediaPipe Pose. Similarly, the mean absolute error of knee angles was 5.88 degrees. The research shows that knee flexion/extension angle can be accurately measured using ML solution for high-fidelity body pose tracking. Professionals involved in the field of biomechanics, sports medicine, physiotherapy as well as other medical fields can use this method as an alternative markerless approach for knee flexion/extension angle measurement for gait analysis.}
