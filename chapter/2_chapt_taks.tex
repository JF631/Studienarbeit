\chapter{Tasks}
This chapter provides an overview over all tasks that are approached in this
project.
Hardware related tasks are listed as well as software related tasks.
Each main task is divided into several sub-tasks.

\begin{description}
    \item[Task 1] Develop a platform independent computer software to analyze 
    pre-recorded long-jump videos.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Implement a video processing pipeline to analyse a jump regarding 
        a fixed set of parameters.
        \item Develop an algorithm to automatically detect the take-off frame.
        \item Define and implement an analysis output standard.
        \item Validate the performance to allow on-field jump analysis 
        \item Implement a \acs*{GUI} to visualize the analysis results.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[Task 2] Build a quadcopter as hardware companion for recording 
    long-jump videos. This specifically requires a camera as well as several
    sensors for navigation.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select hardware components according defined criteria.
        \item Build a flying quadcopter that is controllable from a ground
        station.
        \item extend the quadcopter with a companion computer and a compatible
        camera to live stream videos.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[Task 3] Implement a software that allows to control the drone from a
    ground station.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Set up a wireless connection to the quadcopter.
        \item Implement a drone control offering movement control.
        \item Integrate the drone control in the \acs*{GUI}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[Task 4] Develop a software to handle the incoming video livestream.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Establish a connection to the on-board companion computer.
        \item Display the video frames in the \acs*{GUI}.
        \item Offer the option for a rudimentary live analysis.
    \end{enumerate}
