\chapter{Tasks}\label{chapt:2_tasks}
This chapter provides an overview of all tasks that are approached in this
project.
Each main task is divided into several sub-tasks which are implemented in
\autoref{chapt:4_implementation}.

\begin{description}
    \item[Task 1] Develop a platform independent computer software to analyze 
    pre-recorded long-jump videos.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Implement a video processing pipeline to analyse a jump regarding 
        a fixed set of parameters.
        \item Develop an algorithm to automatically detect the take-off frame.
        \item Define and implement an analysis output standard.
        \item Validate the performance to allow on-field jump analysis.
        \item Implement a \acs*{GUI} to visualize the analysis results.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[Task 2] Build a quadcopter as hardware companion for recording 
    long-jump videos. This specifically requires a camera as well as several
    sensors for navigation.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select hardware components according defined criteria.
        \item Build a flying quadcopter that is controllable from a ground
        station.
        \item Extend the quadcopter with a companion computer and a compatible
        camera to live stream and record videos which can be analyzed.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[Task 3] Implement a software that allows to manually and automatically
    control the drone.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Set up a wireless connection to the quadcopter.
        \item Implement a drone control offering movement control.
        \item Integrate the drone control in the \acs*{GUI}.
        \item Implement an auto-follow like feature.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[Task 4] Develop a software to handle the incoming video livestream.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Establish a connection to the on-board companion computer.
        \item Display the video frames in the \acs*{GUI}.
        \item Offer the option for a rudimentary live analysis.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{description}
