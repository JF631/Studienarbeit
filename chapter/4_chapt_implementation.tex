\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter focuses on the overall project's implementation.
It mainly covers the four parts hardware assembly, long jump analysis,
drone control and their consolidation into one \ac{GUI}.

\section{Hardware}\label{sec:4_hardware}
In order to capture high-quality video recordings that cover a complete long 
jump, from the first step all the way to the landing, a drone is used to fly
next to the athlete throughout the whole process.
Thus, a drone in form of a quadcopter is built from scratch.
Its control will be integrated seamlessly in the projects' \ac{GUI}.\\
This section introduces the hardware components that are used for building 
this drone as well as its flight control unit.\\
A short outline of the hardware is given in.
The assembly is shown in, while ... focuses on the PixHawk flight 
controller and its setup.

\subsection{Drone Basis}\label{subsec:4_drone_basis}
As basis for the quadcopter I chose a \textit{Holybro S500 V2} frame kit that 
includes basic components such as a landing gear and rotors as well as a 
dedicated platform for a flight control unit and a battery.
Furthermore, the main platform already includes a \ac{PDB} to split the 
battery's power equally to all four motors.
Additionally, motors with one \ac{ESC} each are mounted on the frame kit to be
able to control the motor speed individually.
