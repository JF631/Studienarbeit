\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}
Finally, a complete drone based long-jump evaluation tool has been developed.
Therefore, a drone was built from scratch which allows recording long-jump
videos of athletes during their training.
The drone is fully controllable by a custom implement software running on a
ground station PC.
The ground station software is able to analyze any pre-recorded long-jump
video regarding knee angles, arm angles and takeoff conditions (takeoff
position and takeoff angle).
